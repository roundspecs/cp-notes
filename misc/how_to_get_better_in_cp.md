# How to get better in CP
Solving a problem in CP requires two skills:
1. [Designing algorithm](#1-designing-algorithm)
2. [Implementing algorithm](#2-implementing-algorithm)

So, if you want to get better at CP, you have to work on these two skills.

## Why is CP difficult
The reason why CP is fun is the same reason why CP seems difficult to many. Its easy to solve problems that are similar to problems you have solved before. But the main goal of CP is to **invent new solutions** rather than solving it from memory. This is why CP seem difficult: you will have to struggle to come up with solution. And this, is what makes CP fun.

## The most imporant advice
Don't start typing code before solving the problem on paper.\

## Skill 1: Designing algorithm
This is the part where you come up with a solution, and this is where you spend most of your time.\
Here are some tips for you:
- If the problem seems too difficult, instead of attacking the problem directly, temporarily reduce the complexity of the problem.\
**Example**: Find all occurances of a given word in a string and replace with another word.\
**Simplified**: Find first occurance of a given word in a string and replace with another word.
- Learn descrete mathematics. Here is why:
  - Logic is defined as *The study of the laws of thought*, and I don't know about subject that teaches you the laws of logic more regorously that Descrete Mathematics
  - The main reason why I believe descrete mathematics is important for designing algorithms is because it teaches you how to prove that the algorithm is efficient and correct.
  - If you know how to prove the correctness of an algorithm, you can modify it to work on other similar situations. 
  - And technically, proofs are all we know. Here is a quote I read in a book:
    > The statements that we have proved are called theorems. And the collection of all the theorems about a topic is what we know about that topic.
- Learn the ins and outs of Algorithms and Data Structures. You might have the temptation to use algorithms and data structures as a black box that does what you want it to do, but you have no clue how it works. Yes, this strategy surprisingly works and you will be able to go a long way without learning how vector, queue or stack works behind the scene, but you will have a better understanding of when you use which algorithm or data structure if you know how they work.
- During the contest, solve the problems as fast as you can. But after the contest, make sure to review the problems and try to actually learn from it. Note down the relevant concepts and strategies. Try to generalize the solution so that if you are given a similar problem, you can solve that easily.
- Don't ask for help

## Skill 2: Implementing algorithm
For this you need good programming skils. Here are a few tips:
1. Type faster
1. Learn to type concise code
1. Learn a good coding style
